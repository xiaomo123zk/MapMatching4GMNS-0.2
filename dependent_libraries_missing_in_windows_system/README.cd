 I searched for a solution to the problem of missing dependent files when calling DLL in python. The method given on the blog is to find all the dependent files of the DLL, 
 and then copy these dependencies to C:\Windows\System32. Note here that if there are some dependencies in the C:\Windows\System32, 
 you only need to copy the dependencies that are not. I used this method to run the code without installed a C++ environment. 
 If VS is not installed on your computer, I will send you the DLL dependency and test code. You can try it on a windows computer.
 
 
 This folder is the absent dependencies about mapmatching4gmns.
 If your computer have some dependencies in the C:\Windows\System32, you only need to copy the dependencies that are not
